COMMAND TO RUN THIS: "python -m http.server [PORT-NUMBER]"

A user can:
- select any two attributes from the list, 1 from each dropdown
- select 1 of 3 visualization types (histogricam, chloropleth, and scatterplot)
- gain data about their visualizations that were generated from the category selections via tooltips
- NOTE: some categories, such as Urban/Rural status, do not currently work as intended due to time constraints I chose to focus on getting things working dynamically for the MAJORIT of categories.
